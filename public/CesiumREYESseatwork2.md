  <div class="sidebar">Sidebar</div>

</html>
```
### Step 1 (Static vs Relative):

- Add in css ```position: relative; top: 20px; left: 20px;``` to .sidebar.

- Guided Question: What changed compared to the default static positioning? Try to give different values to top and left or you can change it to bottom, right.
**The change that happened was that the "sidebar" block moved on the page. Instead of being in a fixed and strict position, it overlapped the content container. Whenever I change the values to move it around, it's able to overlap other elements instead of adjusting so that all the elements are still in a sort of "grid" structure and are just beside, on top or on the bottom of each other.**

### Step 2 (Fixed):

- Add in css ```position: fixed; bottom: 0; width: 100%;``` to .footer.

- Guided Question: What happens when you scroll the page? Why does the footer behave differently from position relative?
**When I scroll the page, the footer doesn't really move along with it. It stays stationary, and I think that's how it behaves differently from position relative. When you use position:fixed, it orients the element relative to a browser's viewport so that when you scroll or move the browser, it does not change its positioning. This is different from position:relative, which is a bit more "fluid" and changes elements relative to how you orient or position the screen and other elements.**

### Step 3 (Absolute):

- Add in css ```position: absolute; top: 66px; left: 200px;``` to .content.

- Guided Question: What is the effect of position: absolute on an element? How is it different from fixed?
**position:absolute orients items relative to their nearest position item whilst fixed orients it in terms of the viewport. Basically, position:absolute removes an elements from the normal flow of the layout and it can do things like easily overlap other elements, since it's kind of on a "separate layer."**


### Step 4 : (Absolute)

- Add in html ```<div class="notice">Notice!</div>``` and include the css below:

```css
.notice {
    position: absolute;
    top: 60px;
    left: 400px;
    background: orange;
    padding: 10px;
    z-index: 2;
}
```

- Give .content a z-index: 1.

- Guided Question: Why does the notice appear on top of the content? What happens if you swap the z‑index values?
**Notive appears on top of content because z-index actually controls how elements are stacked and overlapped within a webpage. Since notice's z-index is 2 and content's z-index is 1, the computer reads it as notice being "closer" to the user, therefore making it on top of content. If we were to swap the z-index values, content would be on top instead. However, z-index only works for elements that have some sort of positioning and are not static.**

- Challenge: 
    * What changes that you have to do on the code that will position .notice box on the top right corner of the .content box? Please write the code on paper as well (both html and css on the part of .notice and .content).
    * Try to change the position of .content to relative then to fixed. What do you observed each time?
    * What do you observe on about the effect of z-index on .notice and .content boxes?

3. Please answer the following reflection questions (15 minutes)

    a. Could you summarize the differences between the CSS position values (static, relative, absolute, fixed)? 

    b. How does absolute positioning depend on its parent element?

    c. How do you differentiate sticky from fixed (you can research on sticky)?

    d. If you were designing a webpage for a school event, how might you use positioning to highlight important information? Please give concrete examples.
